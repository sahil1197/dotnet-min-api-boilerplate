A branching strategy:

Feature/Containerization - This branch is usaed to containerize application.

All work happens in feature branche

We use a GitHub flow branching strategy.
main always stays production-ready.
All development happens in feature branches like feature/containerization.
Changes are merged only through pull requests, which enforce code reviews and approvals.
This gives us better quality, traceability, and governance
